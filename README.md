# RAK7371 Configurations for LoRaWAN Gateway Setup

This repo consists of some configurations/settings that I was able to successfuly use in order to setup the [RAK7371 WisGate Developer Base](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisgate-developer-base?variant=39942858703046) with my laptop running a linux OS as a LoRaWAN Gateway on [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). The following two methods and directories have the associated files in them:

__basicstation__: docker-compose YAML file to use the LoRa Basicsâ„¢ Station using docker based on Xose Perez's [basicstation](https://github.com/xoseperez/basicstation).
__packet_forwarder__: global configuration file to be used in conjunction with Semtech's [sx1302_hal](https://github.com/Lora-net/sx1302_hal)
